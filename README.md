COE301: Computer Architecture Lab Slides
===========================

This is the lab slides used in the _Computer Architecture_ course (COE 301)
of the [Computer Engineering][coe] program in
[King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM)][kfupm].

Experiments are based on MIPS 32-bit processor. We utilize [MARS] (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator) which is an IDE for MIPS Assembly Language Programming.

The slides are written using the [Latex-Beamer] format. The included `Makefile` can be used to generate PDF
output for a given source file using the command `make`.

Pre-generated PDF output are available at:  
http://www.ccse.kfupm.edu.sa/~salehs/courses/222-coe301/

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome.
